This project was created as part of the requirement for the Erodos Data Science Fall Bootcamp 2023. The project named as 'CreditGuard' aims to use the wealth of historical financial data for credit card customers to apply supervised Machine Learning methods on to predict the delinquency threat for new creditors. The various models used show us their respective efficiencies in predicting for the risk of delinquency for prospective customers.
